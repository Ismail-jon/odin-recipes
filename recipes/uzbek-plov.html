    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>4 whole heads garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless leg of lamb, cut into 3-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>5 large carrots, coarsely grated</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh barberries</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cumin seeds</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coriander seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 cups boiling water to cover</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place basmati rice in a large bowl; cover with warm water and set aside.
            Wash whole heads garlic; set aside.</li><br>
        <li>
            Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or large skillet over high heat
            until smoking. Add lamb; cook, turning occasionally,
            until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in onions; cook and stir 
            until softened and browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in carrots; cook and 
            stir until softened, about 10 minutes. Add barberries, cumin, coriander,
            and peppercorns; drop whole heads garlic into Dutch oven, stirring 
            to evenly distribute. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook 30 minutes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Wash and drain basmati rice with hot water; add to Dutch oven in an even
            layer on top of lamb. Slowly pour in 2 cups boiling water. The rice should
            be covered with about 3/4-inch water. Do not stir. Season with salt; reduce
            heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until rice is tender and liquid absorbed,
            about 20 minutes. Stir rice and lamb together; serve with whole garlic
            heads on top.
